	<h3>Summary and Operations</h3>

	<p>
	FarmBot's mission is to promote sustainable agriculture by creating products <br>
	that simplifies growing your own food that anyone can use, regardless of time <br>
	commitment and available space. Making these products will then generate <br>
	funding for R&D in another one of our products, technology in vertical <br>
	farming for larger scale agricultural operations. <br>
	</p>

	<h3> Organizational Structure</h3>
	<p>

	To keep track of all the things that need to be done, the business will be 
	organized into subteams, R&D or Design, Manufacturing, Business, Marketing, and software. Each subteam will 
	have a manager that makes decisions, and will meet with managers of other 
	subteams to ensure that each team's decisions are compatible with each other.

	<h3>Long Term Growth, Stregnths, and Weaknesses</h3>
	<p>
	Because of how our product is designed around an autonomous software, the product is easy to improve and update.
	We will also be able to capitalize on the public interest in environmentalism and organic or fresh foods.
	On the other hand, the demographic interested and able to purchase the product isn't high. With our larger scale 
	vertical agricultural technology, it may be too expesive compared to conventional methods. But it offers them more farmland
	without taking much horizontal land, which is appealing to farmers who don't own as much land. Overtime, we can improve on price and efficiency of our product to increase consumer demand.
