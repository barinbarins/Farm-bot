	<h3 style="text-align:center;">Summary and Operations</h3>

	<p style="text-align:center;">
	FarmBot's mission is to promote sustainable agriculture by creating products <br>
	that simplifies growing your own food that anyone can use, regardless of time <br>
	commitment and available space. Making these products will then generate <br>
	funding for R&D in another one of our products, technology in vertical <br>
	farming for larger scale agricultural operations. <br>
	</p>

	<h3 style="text-align:center;"> Organizational Structure</h3>
	<p style="text-align:center;">

	To keep track of all the things that need to be done, the business will be <br>
	organized into subteams, R&D or Design, Manufacturing, Business, Marketing, <br>
	and software. Each subteam will have a manager that makes decisions, and will <br>
	meet with managers of other subteams to ensure that each team's decisions <br>
	are compatible with each other.
	</p>

	<h3 style="text-align:center;">Long Term Growth, Stregnths, and Weaknesses</h3>
	<p style="text-align:center;">
	Because of how our product is designed around an autonomous software, the <br>
	product is easy to improve and update. We will also be able to capitalize on <br>
	the public interest in environmentalism and organic or fresh foods. On the <br>
	other hand, the demographic interested and able to purchase the product isn't <br>
	high. With our larger scale vertical agricultural technology, it may be too <br>
	expesive compared to conventional methods. But it offers them more farmland <br>
	without taking much horizontal land, which is appealing to farmers who don't own <br>
	as much land. Overtime, we can improve on price and efficiency of our product <br>
	to increase consumer demand.
