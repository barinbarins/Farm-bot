	<h1> Our Business Plan</h1>

	<p>
	FarmBot's mission is to promote sustainable agriculture by creating products that simplifies growing your own food that anyone can use, regardless of time commitment and available space. Making these products will then generate funding for R&D in another one of our products, technology in vertical farming for larger scale agricultural operations. To keep track of all the things that need to be done, the business will be split into subteams, R&D or Design, Manufacturing, Business, Marketing, and software. Each subteam will have a manager that makes decisions, and will meet with managers of other subteams to ensure that each team's decisions are compatible with each other.
